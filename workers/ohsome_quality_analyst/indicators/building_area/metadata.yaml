BuildingArea:
  name: Building Area
  description: |
    Comparison between the expected building area and the building area mapped in OSM.
    This can give an estimate if mapping has been completed.
  label_description:
    red: |
      The building area mapped in OSM is significantly less than expected, which 
      indicates that many buildings have not mapped yet (OSM building area ≤ 75% of 
      expected building area).
    yellow: |
      The building area mapped in OSM is less than expected, which indicates that 
      buildings in this area are not mapped in their entirety. However, a good amount of
      buildings is already mapped (75% ≤ OSM building area < 95% of expected building 
      area).
    green: |
      The building area mapped in OSM matches or exceeds the expected building area, 
      which indicates a good data quality in terms of completeness (95% ≤ OSM building 
      area of expected building area).
    undefined: |
      The quality level could not be calculated for this indicator.
  result_description: |
    The building area mapped in OSM is $building_area sqkm and the expected building 
    area for this feature is $predicted_building_area sqkm. Accordingly, the area mapped
    in OSM is $percentage_mapped of the expected area
